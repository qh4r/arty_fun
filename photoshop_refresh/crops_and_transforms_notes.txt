**** C --- CROP TOOL
   * you can drag handles on sidesof image and press enter to accept crop - therefor cutting down canvas
   * if DELETE CROPPED PIXELS is not selected crop tool will sort of hide the cropped pixels
     - they will not be visible in normal mode and picture will appear cropped
     - they will become visible if accessing crop mode again.
     - it's best to rly delete pixels as a last resort
   * to get back NON DELETED CROPPED PIXELS go to IMAGE > REVEAL ALL

   * using crop tool you can expand canvas if you drag 'crop area' outside of curren canvas
   * DRAGGING CROP AREA WITH ALT MAKES IT START FROM CENTER SAME LIKE IT WORKS FOR SELECTION TOOL

**** if you hold CMD while adding layer it will be added underneath instead of over

**** in IMAGE > CANVAS SIZE
   * relative causes the addition or substraction of given value from current size of canvas

**** PERSPECTIVE CROP - lets you select non standard areas and crop with changing perspective
   * there is no option to preserve pixels in this kind of crop

**** IF YOU PRESS AND HOLD outside of CROP TOOL SELECTION you will be able to ROTATE THE SELECTION/IMAGE
**** you can also use STRAITHEN option available in top menu while cropping to draw a line that should be made horizontal

**** In FREE TRANSFORMATION you can distort while holding CMD
   * with alt it dorts using selected and oposing node

**** CMD + ALT + SHIFT + C --- CONTENT AWARE SCALE - it allows you to rescale only 1 dimension the smart way so that
     image is not getting distorted
   * YOU CAN USE SAVED SELECTION in PROTECT dropdown to say CONTANT AWARE SCALE THAT IT SHOULD NOT TOCH CERTAIN AREA

**** PUPPET WRAP 
   * EDIT > PUPPET WRAP
   * smartli selects humans and allows you to transform humanoidal selection using pins and dragging
   - pin blocks element - then you can drag stuff around
   - pin depth can control what part of selection is on top
   * YOU CAN USE PUPPET WRAP FOR OTHER types of structures

**** PERSPECTIVE WRAP
   * EDIT > PERSPECTIVE WRAP 
   - you can change perspective of image parts inside layout selection
   - to lock part of image make separate layout selection for it
   - it's too easy to disort whole image, you will problaly need to crop sides anyway
