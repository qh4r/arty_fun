**** O - DODGE TOOL
   * lightens areas in image
   - also there (same shortcut):
   * BURN TOOL - darkens image
   * SPONGE TOOL -saturate or desaturate
**** CMD + J -- duplicate layer

*** CMD + SHIFT + N -- new layer

**** S - CLONE STAMP TOOL
   * it's best to use this tool with new layer with setting SAMPLE to CURRENT & BELOW 
     - this way we do not apply destructive changes to layer that we want to alter
     -  we use image as a source but new empty layer as a target
   * you target sample with OPTION and apply without it

**** J - SPOT HEALING BRUSH - do not need samplingn and allow photoshop algorythms to smartly remove all defects in clicked place

**** J - HEALING BRUSH - WORKS LIKE CLONE STAMP BUT it tries to match tone/ texture

**** J - PATCH TOOL  - lets you fix whole areas
       - good to use content aware
        * ITS GREAT TO USE IT FOR BIGGER AREAS 
        ~ when we want to remove something quite large and surrounded by sth complex from photo
        * if there is a lot of detail and content aware adds blur to edges
         - it's best to use Patch: Normal
        
**** It's also possible to select area  and use EDIT > FILL.. and chose CONTENT AWARE FILL and let photoshop do the magic
     - but it might be less precise
     * FILL --> SHIFT + F5

**** J - CONTENT AWARE MOVE TOOL works like PATCH TOOL but it moves elements (so applies changes in 2 palces)
      - if you select Mode: EXTEND instead of MOVE - it will not remove source element

**** E - ERASER TOOL
     E - BACKGROUND ERASER TOOL - has nice behavior with SAMPLE ONCE MODE - it removes only one color


**** EASY SHARPENING
    - COPY LAYER
    - USE FILTER > OTHER > HIGH PASS FILTER 
    - USE LOW VALUE (like 9)
    - SET COPIED FILTERED LAYER BLENDING MODE TO OVERLAY (which ignores gray)
    - PROFIT ~ MAGIC

*** SHARPEN, BLUR and SPONGE tools are not that useful BETTER STAY AWAY
