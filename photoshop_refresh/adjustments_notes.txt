**** ON HISTOGRAM PANEL - dark values are on LEFT and white values are on RIGHT - i basicaly goes from 0 to 255

**** It's best to use adjustments as layers (IN ADJUSTMENTS PANEL)
     because applying them via IMAGE > ADJUSTMENTS is destructive while adding layer is not

**** If you add adjustment lyaer to a group it will affect only layers UNDER IT in THAT GROUP 

*** In LEVELS we can adjust Number that will be treated AS TRUE WHITE and TRUE BLACK
    -  defaults are 0 for black and 255 for white
    -  it might be good idea to set those values to sides of histogram,
      so that only the values rly used in the image are covered by LEVELS RANGE

**** YOU CAN ADD MASKS TO ADJUSTMENT LYERS just click on linked mask and paint on it black/white (can use gradient)

***** CMD + SHIFT + I -- INVERSE SELECTION

**** IF YOU CHOOSE ADJUSTEMNT WHILE HAVING SELECTION MADE 
      -- IT WILL AUTOMATICLY CREATE MASK THAT TOUCHES ONLY THIS SELECTION

**** if you CLIP ADJUSTMENT LAYER it will only affect layer RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT and won't affect layers further down
    -- you an do it by holding OPTION and clickin mouse between ADJUSTMENT AND LAYER UNDER IT

**** CURVES ADJUSTMENT
    -- gives yo more control then levels
    -- it gives you more flexibility but is much harder to use then LEVELS

**** HUE/SATURATION
   * you can change colors
   * if want to get MONO TONE (one color) use colorize option

**** VIBRANCE
   * it's better version of hue saturation for saturation purposes
   * Vibrance is better choice if you dont care about changing color but rather about pure saturation

**** PHOTO FILTER ADJUSTMENT
   * it has some presets that allow you to add some simple adjustments based on real life camera lens filters
